# 9.7.4. groupwork Programming Challenge: Savings Account
In the following code, a bank account class contains the account holderâ€™s name and the money balance in the account.

Work in pairs to write the following code and test each part before moving on to the next step:

1. Write a subclass called SavingsAccount that extends Account and adds an interest rate variable.

2. Write a constructor with 3 arguments (name, balance, interest rate) for the SavingsAccount class that uses the super constructor.

3. Write a toString() method for SavingsAccount that returns a call to the super toString() method and the interest rate.

4. Write an equals method for SavingsAccount that calls the superclass equals method and checks that the interest rates are equal.

Complete the subclass SavingsAccount below which inherits from Account and adds an interest rate variable. Write a constructor with 3 arguments, a toString, and an equals method for it. Uncomment the code in main to test your new class and methods.
